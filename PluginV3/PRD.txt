# PRD Utility Plugin for Stereo Processing

## 1. Overview & Purpose

### Introduction
Create a utility plugin designed for precise stereo manipulation and gain control. This plugin provides a suite of tools including
- LR separate metering
- LR separate gain
- Phase invert
- Phase offset
- Stereo placement visualization (similar to KHS Stereo)
- Input and output gain
- Midside gain

### Goals & Objectives
- Deliver a tool that offers granular control over stereo audio signals.
- Provide clear, separate metering and gain controls for leftright channels.
- Implement advanced phase controls (invert, offset) to resolve phase issues.
- Allow precise stereo placement visualization and adjustments.
- Offer inputoutput gain and midside gain adjustments for flexible audio shaping.
- Roll out features incrementally for robust testing and personal exploration.

## 2. Background & Context

### Technical Context
- Target Environment Personal use for audio manipulation and detailed stereo imaging.
- Existing Solutions Refining concepts seen in tools like KHS Stereo, with additional functionality and a more user-friendly interface.
  
### Problem Statement
Balancing stereo imagery, phase issues, and gain inconsistencies in audio can be challenging. This plugin addresses these challenges by offering separate controls and detailed visual feedback.

## 3. Features & Functionality

Implement features one at a time for incremental development and testing

1. LR Separate Metering
   - Function Display individual level meters for left and right channels.
   - Purpose Provide real-time visual feedback for balanced channel levels.
   - Notes Focus on clean, intuitive visuals.

2. LR Separate Gain
   - Function Adjust gain independently for the left and right channels.
   - Purpose Enable precise level matching and correction.
   - Notes Use knobs or slider controls with fine adjustment capabilities.

3. Phase Invert
   - Function Toggle phase inversion for one or both channels.
   - Purpose Resolve phase cancellation issues.
   - Notes Include clear visual indication (e.g., icon change) when phase is inverted.

4. Phase Offset
   - Function Adjust the phase offset (timing difference) of the channels.
   - Purpose Provide additional phase correction for complex mixes.
   - Notes Ensure smooth control for subtle adjustments.

5. Stereo Placement
   - Function Visualize and adjust the stereo image.
   - Purpose Allow real-time positioning of sounds within the stereo field.
   - Notes Develop an interactive interface (e.g., draggable marker on a stereo field diagram).

6. Input and Output Gain
   - Function Control the overall input and output levels of the plugin.
   - Purpose Ensure optimal signal flow before and after processing.
   - Notes Implement clear gain staging with monitoring meters.

7. MidSide Gain
   - Function Provide separate gain controls for mid and side channels.
   - Purpose Enable advanced processing for stereo width and balance.
   - Notes Consider this feature after establishing the basic stereo controls.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### Platform & Environment
- Plugin Formats Consider VST, AU, and potentially AAX.
- Supported DAWs Ensure compatibility with major digital audio workstations.
- Operating Systems Target Windows and macOS.

### Architecture & Design
- Modular Design Develop each feature as an independent module for easier testing and updates.
